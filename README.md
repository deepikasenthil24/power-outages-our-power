# Power Outages: An Investigation into What's Really in Our Power
 This is a project for DSC80 at UCSD, in which I will be cleaning my dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, assessing missingness, conducting permutation tests, creating a classification model, and judging fairness.

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |

## Hypothesis Testing

' px.scatter(x=inputd["POPDEN_RURAL"], y=inputd["OUTAGE.DURATION"], title='OUTAGE DURATION for Rural Populatin Densities', labels={'x': 'Rural Population Density', 'y': 'Power Outage Duration'})''
'fig.write_html('file-name.html', include_plotlyjs='cdn')'
